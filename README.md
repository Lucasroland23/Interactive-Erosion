# Interactive-Erosion

## Overview
**Interactive Erosion** is a project focused on simulating terrain erosion using natural processes, based on the article *Interactive Terrain Modeling Using Hydraulic Erosion* and utilizing parts of the code from **ShaderX7**. The project is aimed at creating more realistic height maps for 3D landscapes by applying a series of erosion processes on the GPU. These processes include force-based erosion, dissolution-based erosion, and material slippage. Each process affects the height map through dynamic adjustments, and the map is represented by a series of layers, each with unique erosion settings to simulate various terrain types like soft soil, sand, and base rock layers.

## Features
- **Force-Based Erosion**: Erosion caused by forces like water flow, which removes material from the terrain.
- **Dissolution-Based Erosion**: Chemical processes that gradually affect the terrain surface.
- **Material Slippage**: Movement of materials due to gravitational or other forces.
- **Layered Height Map**: Different terrain types are represented by distinct layers (e.g., rock, soil, sand) with individual erosion settings.
- **GPU-Accelerated**: All erosion processes are computed on the GPU for high performance and real-time feedback.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to get started with the **Interactive-Erosion** project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasRoland23/interactive-erosion.git
```

Ensure that you have the required dependencies and an environment that supports GPU computation (such as Unity or other graphics frameworks).

# MeshVoxelizationSystem

## Overview
The **MeshVoxelizationSystem** is a cutting-edge framework designed to convert complex 3D mesh objects into voxel-based grids, optimized for advanced modeling and simulation within game engines. This system enables efficient rendering and processing of voxelized grids, allowing for complex computations in game development and simulations.

However, certain elements of this system have been **illegally adapted** for **unauthorized game cheats**, including wallhacks and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) cheats. These adaptations exploit the core functionality of the system, violating copyright laws and the terms of use. These cheats allow players to gain unfair advantages by revealing hidden objects and player positions within a game environment.

## Proof of Authorship
**MeshVoxelizationSystem** was developed by **Lucas Hunt** (Lucas Roland). The initial version was created on **February 7, 2023**. All code, algorithms, and rendering techniques are proprietary and protected under copyright law. Any unauthorized use of this software, especially for creating cheats or game exploits, constitutes a direct violation of copyright protection.

### Key Features:
- **Optimized Voxelization Routines**: Converts 3D meshes into efficient voxel grids.
- **Specialized Rendering Pipeline**: Visualizes complex 3D objects by utilizing voxel representations.
- **Efficient Computation**: Highly optimized for game engines and simulation applications.

## Terms of Use and Copyright Protection
By accessing or using this repository, you agree to the following **terms of use**:

- **No Unauthorized Use**: This software is provided for legitimate 3D modeling, simulation, and research purposes only. Unauthorized use, such as using it to create cheats or exploits, is strictly prohibited.
- **No Redistribution or Derivative Works**: You may not redistribute, modify, or create derivative works based on this repository without **explicit written permission** from the author.
- **Copyright Protection**: All use of this software that infringes on these terms will result in immediate legal action, including the filing of a **DMCA takedown** or other copyright enforcement measures.

### Cheat Misuse Documentation:
**MeshVoxelizationSystem** has been misused for creating cheats such as **wallhacks** and **ESP overlays**. These cheats exploit the following features:
- **Rendering Overlays**: Voxel-based rendering techniques that reveal hidden objects and players in a game environment.
- **3D Scanning**: Using the voxelization techniques to display player positions and other in-game objects through walls and obstacles.
